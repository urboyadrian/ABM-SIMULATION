Epidemic Simulation – SIR/SEIR/SIRS/SEIRS Models

Overview
This project simulates the spread of an infectious disease using four classic compartmental models in epidemiology: SIR, SEIR, SIRS, and SEIRS. It combines an agent-based approach with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, and provides both animated and static graphical outputs illustrating the dynamics of the disease over time.

The simulation visualizes two key outputs:

A spatial agent-based animation showing individuals moving and interacting on a 2D grid.

A time-based graph showing the evolution of each compartment (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) across the simulation days.

Models
SIR: Susceptible → Infected → Recovered

SEIR: Susceptible → Exposed → Infected → Recovered

SIRS: Adds immunity loss after recovery

SEIRS: Combines incubation period and immunity loss

Each model is governed by parameters like transmission rate, recovery rate, incubation rate, susceptibility rate, and more.


How to Use :
Launch the program by running the Python script.

Use the GUI to:
1) Select the epidemiological model (SIR, SEIR, SIRS, SEIRS)

2) Modify simulation parameters such as:

Population size

Grid size

Infection radius

Transmission rate (β)

Recovery rate (γ)

Incubation rate (σ) – for SEIR/SEIRS

Susceptibility rate (δ) – for SIRS/SEIRS

Number of time steps (days)

3) Run the simulation by clicking the "Run Simulation" button.


The program will:

Save two GIFs (agent-based and curve-based animations)

Save two static PNG images as snapshots

Open both animations automatically (and reposition the windows if possible)
